publication_short: "The Joy of Consent and the misery of Compulsory Sexuality"

abstract: In this thesis, I argue that feminist philosophers of sex have failed to take the oppressive system of compulsory sexuality seriously. This ommission is dangerous for asexual and nonsexual people. Drawing on Przybyło's work in the book Asexual Erotics, I show how compulsory sexuality influences current theorization on sexual consent. I do so by showing how Manon Garcia's analysis in The Joy of Consent ultimately reproduces compulsory sexuality. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Why feminist philosophers of sex need to learn from Asexuality Studies.
